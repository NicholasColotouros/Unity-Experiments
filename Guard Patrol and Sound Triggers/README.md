# Guard Patrol

This mini-project was to try out sound triggers and to play around with pathfinding using Unity's NavMesh. The guard has a field of view that can be adjusted and walks around randomly until Solid Snake (cube) enters his field of vision, which triggers some sound effects. The guard can see infinitely far if there are no obstacles in the way.

This was made using Unity 5.0
